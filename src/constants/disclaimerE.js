                    Converging the realms of real estate (RE) and virtual assets (VA), this
                    Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) emerges as a uniquely diversified,
                    RE Investment platform built on the blockchain, allowing members to directly
                    benefit from licensed privileges linked to Treasury performance.

                    Always prioritizing the occupier, Bricklayer leverages partnerships with
                    institutional grade tenants to maximize profits whilst reducing operational
                    costs.

                    <br></br>
                    The DAO actively fosters community intelligence, offering a quarterly voting
                    platform to democratically influence and improve Treasury performance. Most
                    importantly, Bricklayer is devised for unprecedented expansion, as the project

                    In contrast to conventional real estate investment platforms, our value
                    proposition is truly innovative. The Treasury maintains a target allocation of
                    75% in the value of real estate assets, while hedging against a 25% allocation
                    in virtual assets. This balanced approach ensures that the platform harnesses
                    the positive effects of crypto-market volatility while mitigating any negative
                    impacts, ultimately fostering a stable income stream for the members.

                        Bricklayer pioneers the combination of the breakthrough potential of virtual
                        assets to the acquisition of a high profile and high yielding real estate
                        portfolio. This peer-to-peer platform leverages blockchain architecture to
                        allow uniquely democratized access to real estate assets normally reserved

                        For decades, the working wage has not inflated at the same pace as real
                        estate values. Thus, multiple generations have started to embrace the
                        blockchain industry because of the low-entry barrier and lucrative
                        opportunities it presents. Nevertheless, one of the main points of
                        apprehension to this nascent adoption is the frustration of market
                        volatility and industry damaging ‘Rug-Pull’ scenarios among other fraudulent
                        schemes. Bricklayer aims to take advantage of this volatility whilst
                        embodying the highest levels of trust through democratic input and
                        prioritizing transparency.

                        <br />
                        Layer 1 involves acquiring a collection of industrial warehouses in Dubai,
                        United Arab Emirates (UAE), tenanted by high credit-worthy tenants (US
                        Fortune 50, e.g. Amazon.com, Tesla, etc.) on institutional 10–20 year lease
                        terms.
                        <br /> <br />
                        The industrial real estate sector has seen significant growth and
                        development over the past few years. Dubai is strategically located between
                        Europe and Asia, making it a key hub for trade and commerce. The government
                        has been proactive in developing infrastructure and creating
                        business-friendly policies, which has attracted numerous industrial
                        companies to set up their operations in the city.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Dubai`s industrial real estate market is primarily focused on logistics and
                        warehousing facilities, with a particular emphasis on serving the region`s
                        e-commerce and retail sectors. The city`s strategic location, coupled with
                        its state-of-the-art infrastructure, including airports, seaports, and
                        highways, has made it a preferred destination for logistics and distribution
                        centers.
                        <br /> <br />
                        The industrial real estate market in Dubai is primarily concentrated in
                        areas such as Dubai South, Dubai Industrial City, and Jebel Ali Free Zone.
                        These areas offer a range of industrial spaces, including warehouses,
                        factories, and production facilities.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Additionally, the government of Dubai has implemented several initiatives to
                        support the growth of the industrial real estate sector. These initiatives
                        include offering tax incentives, providing subsidized land and utilities,
                        and developing specialized industrial zones to cater to specific industries.
                        <br /> <br />

                        Exploring the Expanding Dependency on e-Commerce
                    </h1>
                    <p className="text-[20px] mt-4">
                        Since dependency on e-commerce was exacerbated by the recent pandemic,
                        industrial real estate is now considered the most resilient sector for
                        investment. Last-mile logistics and warehousing is recognized, more than
                        ever, as the essential component of a Metro Service Areas (MSA)
                        infrastructure network. E-commerce has seen a year-over-year growth rate
                        that skyrocketed to 44.5 % in 2021 (Jdsupra, 2022).
                        <br /> <br />
                        Existing supply chain difficulties have been a compounding factor to the
                        rise in demand as occupants are compelled to carry additional inventory,
                        absorb potential network failures, maintain service performance, and meet
                        rising consumer demands.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Overall, the industrial real estate sector in Dubai is expected to continue
                        growing in the coming years, mainly driven by an increasing UAE population,
                        supported by the government`s efforts to create a favorable business
                        environment, coupled with continued demand from e-commerce and retail
                        companies.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Expert knowledge of the market drivers within this most resilient of asset
                        classes, combined with the sector’s most in-demand credit tenants, will
                        provide the most stable, income-producing platform to support consistent
                        expansion of the Treasury.

                        Real Estate Investment DAO (REIDAO) is a new term to accurately reflect the
                        pioneering operations of Bricklayer.
                        <br /> <br />
                        The real estate element of the DAO acts like a traditional Real Estate
                        Investment Trust (REIT) in its acquisition of assets and distribution of
                        income. However, it is important to recognize that shareholders in REITs
                        have a limited impact on contributing to traditional centralized strategy
                        and little to no oversight on any investment decisions discussed in
                        corporate boardrooms.
                        <br /> <br />
                        A REIDAO is structured around a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum
                        blockchain. Its governance model is designed to be community-driven, with
                        decisions made through a transparent and decentralized voting process. It
                        incorporates a variety of blockchain applications to modernize RE
                        transaction processes and benefits from a VA fund to fuel portfolio
                        expansion without the need to rely on subsequent funding rounds.
                        <br /> <br />
                        The first REIT was launched back in 1960 by the National Association of Real
                        Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). This investment vehicle generates
                        competitive, tax efficient returns based on consistent dividend income and
                        longterm capital appreciation. In addition, their low correlation with other
                        assets renders them an effective portfolio diversifier that may help
                        decrease overall portfolio risk and boost returns.
                        <br /> <br />
                        The drawbacks of using traditional REITs for investment include high
                        administrative costs, significant fees and risk of redemption suspensions
                        due to over leveraged debt to equity (D/E) ratios. Bricklayer firmly
                        advocates reducing fees, lowering the D/E ratio, mitigating exposure to
                        interest rate hikes and promoting higher levels of operational transparency
                        and liquidity.

                        established and reputable decentralized exchange (TBC), this allows the
                        token value to be independent from the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the

                        resilient, as the value is underpinned by income producing, physical assets

                        Bricklayer Treasury is designed to reduce risk and ensure long-term
                        sustainability and growth.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Let R be the value of real estate assets and D be the value of virtual

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        T is designed to maintain a 75% weighting in RE assets and a 25% weighting
                        in VA, when the VA portfolio exceeds 35% of T, the Treasury takes profits
                        from the VA portfolio, denoted as P, and invests 75% of those profits into a
                        RE Opportunity Fund, denoted as F:
                        <br />P = 0.75(D - 0.3(R + D)) if D {`>`} 0.4(R + D)
                        <br />P = 0.25D if D {`>`} 0.35T
                        <br />

                        R = R + F
                        <br />
                        The remaining 25% of the profit, to be held in an interest-bearing VA
                        Opportunity Fund, denoted as O:
                        <br />
                        O = 0.25P
                        <br />
                        The DAO can vote to instantly reinvest O:
                        <br />
                        D = D + O
                        <br />
                        Or remain in O, to be deployed when D falls below 15% of the total portfolio
                        value:
                        <br />
                        0.3(R + D) if D {`<`} 0.15(R + D)
                        <br />
                        This approach aims to reduce risk, protect against downside price movement,
                        take advantage of crypto-market volatility, and ultimately enhance NAV and
                        provide a stable income stream to the DAO members.

                    <p className="text-[20px] mt-4">
                        The primary objective of the VA investment strategy is to balance the
                        potential upside of Ethereum with the stability of a USD-pegged stablecoin.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Ethereum`s versatility, developer community and established history make it
                        a compelling choice for members looking to gain exposure to virtual asset
                        markets. While it has experienced some significant price fluctuations over
                        the years, it has also demonstrated resilience and potential for growth over
                        the long term.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Ethereum is one of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, with many exchanges and
                        trading pairs available. This liquidity makes it easy to trade, even during
                        periods of high market volatility. By investing 50% of the fund in Ethereum,
                        the portfolio can potentially capture significant gains in the
                        cryptocurrency market, while the other 50% allocated to a stablecoin can
                        help mitigate risk and provide stability during market downturns.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The quarterly rebalancing of assets will allow for a strategic adjustment of
                        the portfolio`s allocation, ensuring that the investment remains aligned
                        with the fund1s investment goals. The rebalancing process will involve
                        selling a portion of the Ethereum holdings and purchasing additional
                        stablecoins, or vice versa, depending on market conditions.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This approach aims to maximize returns while minimizing downside risks,
                        providing investors with a balanced portfolio that can weather market
                        volatility. The strategy is well-suited for investors who seek exposure to
                        the cryptocurrency market but want to manage risk effectively.

                        The licensed members are expected to work alongside the BCRE throughout the

                    <p className="text-[20px] mt-4">
                        BCRE’s Active Participants (AP) are required to transparently manage the
                        Treasury’s RE and VA portfolios, in conjunction with the management of
                        blockchain security and audit, smart contracts maintenance, treasury
                        oversight and access, legal and compliance, and voting administration.
                        Furthermore, selected APs will be democratically voted in and reviewed
                        annually by the DAO.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Overall, the APs provide managerial guidance that is essential to the
                        success of the DAO. The collective APs are tasked with developing,
                        enhancing, operating, and promoting the DAO. APs fulfill a managerial role
                        within the DAO and are expected to undertake tasks to improve the value of
                        the DAO.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        APs are incentivized with tiered allocations of the $BRICKS and the net
                        proceeds from the 10% retained allowance on Treasury Income. Besides, the
                        APs will be given various operational, maintenance, and executive roles and
                        duties to carry out the tasks that were decided upon by a majority vote. In
                        the days leading up to the AP elections, a detailed RACI chart will be
                        issued.

                        The inaugural AP Elections will be conducted following the completion of the
                        first year of the DAO being in operation. These elections will provide
                        advisors and potential future Bricklayer DAO leaders the chance to
                        selfnominate and propose ideas for new advantageous AP roles.

                        It should be noted that the original team of APs, also known as “Advisor
                        APs,” will not be susceptible to removal through annual AP elections.
                        Alternatively, they will only be able to be removed by a majority rule
                        nomination from the existing APs. Token holders will have the power to vote
                        on whether an Advisor AP should officially leave the DAO only after the AP
                        has been nominated.

                        The DAO voting platform, with a majority rule decision-making process, is
                        superior in transparency when compared to traditional platforms, plagued
                        with potential conflicts and toxic office politics found in corporate and
                        centralized environments. All members can voice their opinions with
                        Bricklayer DAO.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Members voting power is linked to the number of active $BRICKS cemented, one
                        voting credit requires 10,000 cemented $BRICKS.
                        <br /> <br />

                        <br /> <br />
                        Voting credits are restricted to ensure the desired level of project
                        decentralization, each license category is capped with the following $BRICKS
                        thresholds:
                        <br /> <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bricklayer: 80,000 $BRICKS.</li>

                            <li>Investor: 720,000 $BRICKS.</li>
                        </ul>
                        However, the members can purchase and cement more $BRICKS as there is no
                        maximum cap in respect of $BRICKS ownership per license holder.

                        voting credit. The Bricklayer license holder can purchase an additional
                        70,000 $BRICKS to maximize the associated voting leverage to 8 credits and
                        80,000 $BRICKS. Any purchase of additional $BRICKS would not attribute more
                        voting leverage until 90,000 $BRICKS are acquired which would automatically
                        upgrade the member to Developer.
